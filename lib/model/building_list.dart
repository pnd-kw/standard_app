          'The scope of the project included complete renovation of the existing 5,700 sq. ft. structure and 1,300 sq ft of new construction.  Extensive landscape and hardscape improvements were integrated with the new design.  A significant part of the design was to create an enchanting entrance to the home, with a decomposed granite path passing through a small grove of mature olive trees.  The design of the Jenni Kayne home incorporated a dismantled 19th century wood barn, where the different pieces were transformed into new elements.  Large beams formed the entrance pavilion, siding was used for exterior siding and interior ceilings, the maple granary for new doors, and the hardwood off-cuts were reassembled as an island top.',

          'Inspired by Louis Kahn’s Kimbell Art Museum, the home takes the shape of three parallel gabled volumes with stairs between them. Each of these volumes houses different essential spaces and opens up onto an outdoor patio that overlooks the city, reinforcing the connection between home and landscape. The double-height middle volume, which houses an expansive living and dining space, was conceived by the architects as a singular great, big room. The pitch of its ceiling guides the eye toward the expansive glazing at the rear of the house, which opens up to the view over the city, at once providing shelter and inviting the outside in.',
